An example of a reproducible workflow with Snakemake
====================================================

This is my first experience with [Snakemake][sn].
See `./Snakefile` for the workflow. Run `bash make.sh`
to reproduce everything.

## Snakemake

I have tried [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)
for my work to enhance reproducibility and automation
but got stuck with Chinese character issues on GNU Make 
built for Windows. So I tried [Snakemake][sn] and it looks 
pretty good! It is based on Python so fewer cross-platform 
issues should arise. It can generate a 
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) 
for visualizing dependencies between defined workflows, which 
is pretty cool!
